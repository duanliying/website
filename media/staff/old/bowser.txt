Kirsten Bowser's expertise align more closely with real, as opposed to rubber, duckies. She holds a BSc in Wildlife Biology from McGill and an MSc from the University of New Brunswick. She has worked closely with squirrels and various seabirds, but her main interests lie in the interactions between components of an ecosystem, either at larger (marine food webs) or small (gut microbiome) scales.
