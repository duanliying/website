Ingrid joined the Duckietown team after composing an award winning song, "Duckiebots don't cry". She is passionate about songwriting, singing, and dancing, particulary when not wearing any pants. She has a strong affinity for duckies and creates dramatic re-enactments with them during imaginary play both during the day at at bathtime. Ingrid's talents include falling off her chair at the dinner table, being "a little bit cute and a little bit naughty", and riding her scooter.
