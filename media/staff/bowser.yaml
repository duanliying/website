  Holding an MSc in Biology, Kirsten Bowser's expertise align more closely with real, as opposed to rubber, duckies. She has significant experience conducting remote field research for long-term ecological studies. She is also competent in next-generation DNA sequencing and environmental barcoding. Her main research interests lie in the interactions between components of an ecosystem, either at larger (marine food webs) or small (gut microbiome) scales. Currently, Kirsten juggles the needs of her children (both biological and Duckietown-adopted) which runs the gamut from tieing shoes and making lunches to booking CSAIL meeting rooms and editing spreadsheets.
